                Hello" is a song by English singer-songwriter Adele, released on 23 October 2015 by XL Recordings
                as the lead single from her third studio album, 25 (2015). Adele co-wrote the song with her producer,
                Greg Kurstin. "Hello" is a piano ballade with soul influences (including guitar and drums), and lyrics 
                that discuss themes of nostalgia and regret. Upon release, the song was acclaimed by music critics, who
                compared it favourably to Adele's previous works and praised its lyrics, production and Adele's vocal
                performance. It was recorded in London's Metropolis Studios.

                Adele's second chart topper, following "Someone Like You", and had the largest opening week sales in three
                years. In the United States, "Hello" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, reigning for ten consecutive weeks
                whilst becoming Adele's fourth number-one single on the chart and breaking several records, including
                becoming the first song to sell over a million digital copies in a week. By the end of 2015, it had sold 
                12.3 million units globally (combined sales and track-equivalent streams) and was the year's 7th best-selling single while it stands as one of the best-selling digital singles of all-time.
